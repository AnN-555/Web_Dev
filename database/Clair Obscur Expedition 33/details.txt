Break the Cycle. Paint the Future.

Once a year, the Paintress awakens. She paints a number upon her monolith, and every person of that age turns to smoke and fades away. Year after year, that number counts down. Tomorrow, she wakes to paint "33."

Join Gustave and his fellow Expeditioners on a desperate quest through a breathtaking, surreal world to find the Paintress and end her reign of death once and for all.
