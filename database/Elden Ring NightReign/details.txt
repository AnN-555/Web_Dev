Survive the Night. Defy the Shadows.

From the creators of ELDEN RING and Dark Souls comes a new vision of the Lands Between. ELDEN RING NightReign is a standalone, co-op-focused action experience where the shadows are as deadly as the steel they hide. As the sun sets and a cursed darkness falls, the Tarnished must unite to face an onslaught of relentless horrors and colossal Night Bosses.

The cycle of the night has begun. Will you succumb to the dark, or will you ignite the spark of rebellion?
