Wake Up, Rover. A New World Awaits.

Wuthering Waves is a story-rich, open-world action RPG that grants you a high degree of freedom. You awake from your slumber as a Rover, joined by a vibrant cast of Resonators on a journey to reclaim your lost memories and surmount the Lament.

In a world reshaped by the "Solaris-3" catastrophe, every sound carries a story, and every echo can be your greatest weapon.
